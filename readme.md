# Aragon Concierge

Concierge refers to the projects we actively work with to make sure Aragon fits their needs and helping them realize their governance vision using Aragon.

## Projects

- [AGP1](kits/agp1): governance structure for [AGP1](https://github.com/aragon/AGPs/pull/1).
- [Melon Council](kits/melon): a bi-cameral council structure that governs the [Melon](https://melonport.com) protocol and deploys inflation rewards to build the protocol.
- [Token Wrapper](kits/token-wrapper): an aragon app that acts as an ERC20 wrapper which allows token holders to lock in their ERC20 tokens and will mint MiniMe tokens in return to participate in a DAO.
